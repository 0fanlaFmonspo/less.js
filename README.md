HMA VPN is a VPN provider based in the UK with a long and interesting history. Starting with its old name: HideMyAss VPN. While it remains a relatively popular VPN with a large user base, it did not do very well in testing for this HMA VPN review.
 
Today, HMA is owned by the cybersecurity company Avast, and it still has a relatively large user base. Actual testing of the VPN servers and VPN apps revealed mixed results, which prevent us from recommending HMA VPN to our readers.

While IPSec/IKEv2 is indeed a secure VPN protocol, the current industry standard is OpenVPN. As such, it would be good to see the OpenVPN protocol supported on Mac OS as well. With iOS, the operating system is somewhat restricted to IKEv2.
 
Their support hours are 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM UK time, seven days a week. However, I tried support on a Saturday morning around 8:30 AM UK time and there was nobody available. So perhaps HMA support is hit or miss. Other VPN services that offer 24/7 live chat support include CyberGhost and NordVPN.
 
I asked one of their chat representatives why they removed the monthly plan, which I remember seeing on their website before. He explained it was in response to customer requests. He also explained they offer a hidden link for those still wanting the monthly subscription (you can ask support about this).
 
On the topic of price, HMA has nudged its way into the cheap VPN category, with their 36 month plan at $3.39 per month. The 12 month plan is now priced at $4.99 per month. Both these prices are improvements over when we last reviewed HMA.
 
**Note**: If you are looking to save money, you may want to consider some of the different VPN coupons that are currently available. There are also some VPN services that run specials during certain times of the year. For example, there is an upcoming NordVPN Black Friday coupon that will soon be live.
 
One of the most popular streaming services is BBC iPlayer in the UK. To test this, we connected to a HideMyAss server in the UK and then tried to load BBC iPlayer. As you can see below, BBC iPlayer blocked access when connected to a HideMyAss server in the UK.

We also experienced problems with streaming Netflix. I have seen complaints about HideMyAss not working with Netflix, but we also tested it ourselves. Sure enough, when using HMA servers in New York, we were also not able to access American Netflix. We also tested out UK Netflix with HMA servers in London. Again, we were unable to unblock Netflix.
 
Most people use a VPN For Netflix in order to access a wide range of Netflix libraries. If you fall in that category, you may want to check out NordVPN or Surfshark, which each support around 15 different Netflix libraries.
 
While nobody here advocates illegal activity, this case shows that HMA can and will share customer data with third parties. This point is less of an issue today, however, now that HMA is a no-logs VPN.
 
Note: PureVPN also has a history of providing user data logs to authorities. We covered this in our PureVPN vs NordVPN comparison. And you may also want to consider a VPN with ad blocking for added privacy.
 
Hide My Ass is a UK VPN service and must abide by all UK laws and regulations. Despite being owned by Avast, which is a cybersecurity company in the Czech Republic, HMA VPN continues to operate under UK jurisdiction. This is an important consideration.
 
The UK is a member of the 5 Eyes surveillance alliance, which facilitates the collection and sharing of mass surveillance data with other countries. Aside from this formal agreement, US companies can use the UK court system to obtain customer data, such as with the LulzSec case above.
 
Most recently, the UK has begun discussions on creating their own online data protection scheme, which they say will diverge from the GDPR rules which they inherited from their time in the European Union. Considering that the GDPR already does a decent job of protecting online data, it is not clear whether the online privacy situation in the UK will be improving or getting even worse.
 
Next, I ran the VPN through some tests with the website ipleak.net. These tests included switching servers and simulating network interruptions to test if the kill switch was effectively blocking traffic.
 
In some instances, I noticed that the kill switch was not working properly, resulting in an IP address leak (IPv4). Below you can see that my real IPv4 address was leaking out of the VPN tunnel, despite having an active VPN connection to an HMA server in France.
 
To test out HideMyAss speeds, we tested servers in the United States and the UK from our US lab. All tests were conducted on a 500 Mbps internet connection using the official HMA VPN client. Test results were about average.
 
While HMA is certainly not the fastest VPN I have tested, it is also not the slowest. And the speeds were consistent, ranging from about 150 Mbps to 165 Mbps. Overall, this is not a very fast VPN and it also fell behind in our ExpressVPN vs HideMyAss tests.
 
Another big development in VPN speeds is the Lightway protocol, which was developed by ExpressVPN. Lightway delivers fast speeds and is very similar to WireGuard. Still, however, NordVPN was the winner in speed tests for the NordVPN vs ExpressVPN comparison report.
 
HideMyAss was started in 2005 by a student in England who got fed up with content blocks on his school network. Over the following ten years, HideMyAss grew into one of the largest VPN providers with hundreds of thousands of paying users.
 
Our website www.hidemyass.com and services are operated by Privax Limited, which is a limited company registered in England under company registration number 07207304, with our registered office at 110 High Holborn, London, WC1V 6JS, United Kingdom.
 
Overall, HMA VPN is a decent VPN provider. Unfortunately for them, there are several other big-name VPNs that outperform HMA in most categories. While HMA has made progress in some areas, such as with the no-logs audit, there are still other areas to improve, such as speeds and security (leak protection).

I subscribed to HMA VPN for three years without realizing that it shares (probably gets paid for) its data with Google, Facebook and a number of other companies that run personally tailored ads and like to spy on people to earn profits. I learned this from installing the Duckduckgo browser on my Android phone. DDG blocks trackers, allowing me to learn that HMA was taking a $5 or so monthly fee from me for the privilege of having my phone filled with trackers that provided information to these advertising companies.
 
I am very sorry to have ever used HMA and I believe that a class action lawsuit should probably be filed against them. They clearly lie to customers. We were falsely assured that, if we paid them their monthly fees, our privacy would be better protected by using the HMA VPN. I wrote a detailed complaint letter to the company about a year ago. To date, there has been no denial of the activities I accused them of, and they have not responded at all, even though I told them I am cancelling my subscription. Thus, it is fairly clear that they are guilty of everything I have accused them of, above.
 
I have used HMA since November 2023, subscribing for one year. One thing that attracted me about this VPN was its representation across the world, virtual or not. However, I have found that a lot of the exotic locations, I would estimate 50%, actually regularly revert to a Czech IP address (perhaps for obvious reasons). I have tested this time and again. Many of the US server locations revert to an IP in Washington State (currently). When I contacted HMA support in November to inquire as to the reason for this, I never received a response. I quoted the case number they assigned me when I wrote to them again in early December by logging into my HMA account just to note that the case had been closed without explanation. I wrote another support request. To date, I have not received a response. My recommendation is to steer away from this VPN provider.
 
i have tried several times to unsubscribe from HMA VPN without succeding, i have followed all the procedures, have tried many times to contact the support desk withouting getting, in the mean time money has been deducted from my credit card. HMA VPN let me go. there is no doubt its the best software but i dont need to keep on paying for something that i dont use anylonger. i have tried to keep the matters inbox, but i have failed to get help. I GREATLY NEED HELP
 
Several times a day i lose connection. Sometimes i have to reboot my iMAC to get it work again. Streaming is a sh\*t, by example, i look NPO.NL (Dutch) witch is only possible with a Dutch IP. It works, until i lose (again) connection. For streaming i dont recommand HMA.
